## 1. FUNCTIONALITY REMOVAL: Clipboard Copy Buttons

### 1.1 Current State Analysis
The application currently includes clipboard functionality implemented in `app.py` with the following components:
- `create_copy_button()` function (lines 92-207)
- Clipboard toggle in sidebar configuration (lines 252-265)
- Clipboard functionality in article previews (lines 847-940)
- Multiple copy buttons for headlines, content, markdown, metadata, citations, and structured text

### 1.2 Removal Requirements

#### 1.2.1 Code Removal
**HIGH PRIORITY - Remove all clipboard-related code:**

1. **Delete `create_copy_button()` function entirely** (lines 92-207 in `app.py`)
2. **Remove clipboard configuration from `streamlined_sidebar_config()`**:
   - Remove the entire "ðŸ“‹ Clipboard Features" expander section (lines 252-265)
   - Remove `'enable_clipboard': enable_clipboard` from the returned config dictionary
3. **Remove clipboard functionality from `display_batch_results()`**:
   - Remove the entire clipboard section in article previews (lines 847-940)
   - Remove all `create_copy_button()` calls and related UI elements
   - Remove clipboard-related session state variables

#### 1.2.2 UI Cleanup

1. **Remove clipboard-related UI elements**:
   - Remove all "ðŸ“‹ Copy" buttons from article previews
   - Remove "ðŸ“„ Show/Hide" buttons for manual copying
   - Remove text areas that display copied content
   - Remove clipboard-related success messages

#### 1.2.3 Session State Cleanup
**LOW PRIORITY - Clean up session state:**

1. **Remove clipboard-related session state variables**:
   - Remove any session state variables with clipboard-related keys
   - Clean up any clipboard-related state management

### 1.3 Quality Standards for Removal
- **Zero Functionality Loss**: Ensure no other features are affected by clipboard removal
- **Clean Code**: Remove all related imports, variables, and references
- **UI Consistency**: Maintain clean, professional UI without clipboard elements
- **Error Prevention**: Ensure no broken references remain after removal

## 2. FUNCTIONALITY ENHANCEMENT: Single Word Document with Images Folder

### 2.1 Current State Analysis
The application currently has a `convert_to_single_word_document()` function that creates a single Word document, but it needs significant enhancement to meet the new requirements.

### 2.2 Enhancement Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Document Structure Enhancement
**HIGH PRIORITY - Create comprehensive single document:**

1. **Article Order Preservation**:
   - Maintain the exact order of articles as they appear in the uploaded Word document
   - Use the URL extraction order from `extract_urls_from_docx()` as the definitive ordering
   - Ensure articles are inserted into the Word document in the same sequence

2. **Complete Article Components**:
   - **Headline**: Prominent, styled article titles
   - **Drophead**: Subheadings or article subtitles
   - **Source Information**: Publication name, date, author
   - **Full Content**: Complete article body text with proper formatting
   - **URL Reference**: Source URL for each article
   - **Image Integration**: Embedded images within the document

3. **Professional Formatting**:
   - **Typography**: Professional newspaper-style fonts and sizing
   - **Layout**: Clean, readable formatting with proper spacing
   - **Page Breaks**: Separate articles with page breaks
   - **Headers/Footers**: Professional document headers and footers
   - **Table of Contents**: Optional table of contents with article titles

#### 2.2.2 Images Folder Enhancement
**HIGH PRIORITY - Create comprehensive images folder:**

1. **Folder Structure**:
   ```
   article_images/
   â”œâ”€â”€ article_1_source_headline.jpg
   â”œâ”€â”€ article_2_source_headline.png
   â”œâ”€â”€ article_3_source_headline.jpg
   â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

2. **Image Sources**:
   - **Web Articles**: Images extracted from general web articles
   - **Newspapers.com**: Newspaper clipping images from newspapers.com articles
   - **Fallback Images**: Placeholder images for articles without images

3. **Image Naming Convention**:
   - Format: `article_{index}_{source}_{headline}.{extension}`
   - Sanitize filenames for cross-platform compatibility
   - Include article index to maintain order
   - Use descriptive names based on source and headline

4. **Image Quality**:
   - **High Resolution**: Maintain original image quality
   - **Multiple Formats**: Support JPG, PNG, and other common formats
   - **Size Optimization**: Balance quality with file size
   - **Metadata Preservation**: Preserve image metadata where possible

#### 2.2.3 Technical Implementation Requirements

1. **Enhanced Function Development**:

       Returns:
           dict: Document path, images folder path, and metadata
       """
   ```

2. **Order Preservation Logic**:
   - Map processed articles back to their original URL order
   - Handle cases where some URLs failed to process
   - Maintain consistent ordering even with processing failures

3. **Image Processing Enhancement**:
   - Download and process images from multiple sources
   - Handle both URL-based images and newspapers.com clipping images
   - Implement robust error handling for image processing
   - Create descriptive filenames based on article metadata

4. **Document Formatting Enhancement**:
   - Implement professional newspaper-style formatting
   - Add proper page breaks between articles
   - Include article metadata (source, date, URL)
   - Create consistent typography throughout the document

#### 2.2.4 UI Enhancement Requirements

1. **Enhanced Conversion Button**:
   - Update the "ðŸ“„ Single Word Document" button functionality
   - Add progress tracking for document creation
   - Provide detailed feedback on document and images folder creation
